My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This nine-to-five ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh


One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em "Bring another round," we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord


Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They me and Jack Daniеl's got a history
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Evеrybody at the bar gettin' tipsy




I've been Boozey since I left
I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma, I ain't forget ( Lord), I
Woke up drunk at 10 a.m.​
We gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend,  Lord

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em "Bring another round," we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
 my, good Lord


Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They me and Jack Daniel's got a history (We go way back)
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy




One, here comes the two to the three to the four
When it's last call and they kick us out the door
It's gettin' kind of late, but the ladies want some more
 my, good Lord (Tell 'em drinks on me)


Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They me and Jack Daniel's got a history (Way back)
There's a party downtown near 5th Street (Come on)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo-ooh)
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They and Jack Daniel's got a history (It's Jack D)
At the bottom of a bottle, don't miss me (Baby, don't miss me)




That's fuckin' messed up, bro, they kicked me out the bar
