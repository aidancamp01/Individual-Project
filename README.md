Abstract:
For my final project, I have chosen to analyze three different types of music genres most prevalent in my hometown of Sacramento, California, and research the lyrical scheme for each of the genres. 
I will select the two most popular songs of each genre based on the number of streams on Spotify and the popular music tool feature on Shazam that allows users to view what the most streamed songs 
of the week are in a specific city and or area around the country. I got inspiration for this project recently when myself and some friends were discussing the many different and unique genres prevalent 
in Sacramento and what aspects of the songs make them unique, and what common themes are utilized in these diverse genres. The goal of this project is to uncover what makes these genres truly unique. 
While I do listen to music of different genres, I never give any thought to the deeper layers of the songs and how they might connect to songs of the same genre. These indicators, in turn, are what make 
different music genres unique and place them in their own distinct category within the music industry.  Due to its geographically diverse surroundings, Sacramento is known for its rich and eclectic music 
scene, representing a microcosm of broader musical trends across the United States. By focusing on this locale, my project aims to highlight how regional influences shape music genres and their lyrical 
content. This exploration is significant because it provides insight into the cultural, social, and artistic influences that define Sacramento's music scene. Additionally, understanding the common themes 
and unique elements of these genres can contribute to a broader discussion about music categorization, audience engagement, and the further evolution of musical styles.
